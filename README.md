## Issue/Task guidelines

Please ensure all comments and requirements are written in such a way that:

* They identify a single requirement
* The wording is in such a way that is testable (e.g. A need to do a thing, to achieve a thing that does something)
* Constructive feedback only, if you have a rebuke, back it up with a solution.
